Address Insights Map App:
https://address-insights.vercel.app/

Visualize a location on a map, calculate walking/driving scores, and view nearby points of interest.

Built:
App.tsx logic, formatting, and most CSS. API function logic (utils).

Assisted:
Leaflet formatting (never heard of it till today). API function specifics like JSON formatting. Other various little syntax problems.
More specifically: leaflet animations, icons, and elements. A.I. saved me time by not needing to research official documentation.

Approach:
Knock out each requirement one by one. Keep elements and functions pretty barebones for easy adjustments and fixes.
Install TS for strict typing. App was built in one day over periodic spans. 4 hours max.

Design Choices:
Made the querying feel 'dynamic' by rooting a useState with the searchbar label. The function is called immediately
and the inferred address feels responsive. Scores are simple and color coded. History items can auto-fill search field.
